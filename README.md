# Test Multi Selection

This is based off the Xcode 16.0 basic macOS App template, with one line
added to enable the list to support multiple selection. It doesn't work.
On macOS 14.6.1, selecting any more than one item cause the selection to
briefly appear before being deselected. On macOS 15.0, shift-selecting
a range always selects from the first item to wherever you click.
